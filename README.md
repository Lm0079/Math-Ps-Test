# Math-Ps-Test
Scripts to solve simple algebraic math problems.
Originally this rpoject was done in Visual Basics for a collge project. It is being rewritten in Golang and improved in the sense it was previously written badly.

## Quadratic Factorisation
This will factorise a quadratic equation into two brackets and a multipler value.
This will assume all the algebraic variables are the same.
example : `quadratic_factorisation.py 6X^2+4X-2`
